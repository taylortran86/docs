## Error response format
Here is an example of an error response:

```javascript Error Format lines 
Response Code: 422
Response Contents: {
   "error_v2": {
      "error_code": "DEVELOPER_7001",
      "additional_info": {
         "page_size": [
            "Value must be between 2 and 100"
         ]
      },
      "notes": "",
      "message": "Value must be between 2 and 100"
   },
   "error": {
      "page_size": [
         "Value must be between 2 and 100"
      ]
   }
}
```


## Best Practices for Handling Errors
<Steps>
    <Step title = "Inspect HTTP Status Codes">
    Use status codes to identify the category of the error (e.g., `4xx` for client errors, `5xx` for server errors).
    </Step>
    <Step title = "Utilize the `error_v2` Field">
    Parse the `error_code` and `additional_info` to pinpoint the issue and provide actionable feedback in your application.
    </Step>
    <Step title = "Log Errors">
    Log error responses, including the `x-trace-id` from the response headers, for easier debugging and communication with Ramp developer support.
    </Step>
    <Step title = "Implement Retry Logic">
    For transient errors (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests` or `5xx`), implement exponential backoff to retry requests.
    </Step>
    <Step title = "Provide User Feedback">
    Use the `message` field to display clear and concise error messages to users, when applicable.
    </Step>
