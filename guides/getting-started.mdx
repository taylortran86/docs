## Understanding environments
Ramp offers two environments:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sandbox">
| Base URL                    | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://demo-api.ramp.com` | For testing and development. Contains demo data. Apps created here only work in this environment. |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Production">
| Base URL                | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://api.ramp.com`  | For live use. Interacts with your real Ramp account. Use only after testing in Sandbox. |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quickstart: Authorize with Client Credentials
<Warning>
<b>Permission Required</b>
<br/>API access requires ADMIN or IT_ADMIN role. If you don't see "Developer API" in your Ramp account or get permission errors, contact your Ramp administrator to upgrade your permissions. Managers and regular users cannot create apps or generate tokens.
</Warning>


<Accordion title = "Create a developer app">
1. Press CMD + K and select Developer API in your Ramp account (or Sandbox).
2. Click Create New App.
3. Name your app, accept the Terms, and click Create.
4. Under Grant types, click Add new grant type → select Client Credentials.
5. Under Scopes, click Configure allowed scopes and select transactions:read (or others as needed).
6. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret. These will be used in your token request.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title = "Request an Access Token">
You’ll authenticate with your Client ID and Secret to get a token:

```Authorization Header```: This contains the Client ID and Client Secret, encoded in base64. The format is Authorization: Basic ```<base64(client_id:client_secret)>```.
```Content-Type```: ```application/x-www-form-urlencoded```
```grant_type```: ```client_credentials```
```scope```: space-separated list of scopes (e.g., ```transactions:read```)

If successful, you’ll receive a response like this:

```javascript
{
  "access_token": "ramp_tok_abc123...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 864000,
  "scope": "transactions:read"
}
```
Copy the access_token – you’ll use it to authenticate your API calls.
<Danger>
<b>Access and refresh tokens should never be transmitted or stored without encryption.</b>
