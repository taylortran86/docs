## What is MCP?
The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) enables AI assistants to securely connect to your business data and systems. Instead of copying and pasting information or switching between applications, you can ask your AI assistant direct questions about your Ramp account and get instant, accurate answers.
